## PRIMARY ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK

### 1. VISION IDENTIFICATION
**For each speaker/participant, identify whether their statements reflect:**

**CONSTRAINED VISION INDICATORS (Sowell-aligned):**
- References to human nature limitations or self-interest as unchangeable
- Emphasis on trade-offs rather than perfect solutions
- Skepticism toward comprehensive planning or expert-designed systems
- Focus on systemic processes over individual intentions
- Acceptance of unequal outcomes if processes are fair
- References to unintended consequences of well-meaning policies
- Preference for gradual, tested changes over revolutionary reforms
- Citations of historical precedent or accumulated experience
- Emphasis on incentive structures and behavioral constraints

**UNCONSTRAINED VISION INDICATORS (Sowell-opposed):**
- Belief in human perfectibility through education or enlightenment
- Calls for comprehensive solutions to eliminate problems entirely
- Faith in expert planning and rational design of social systems
- Focus on individual intentions and moral imperatives
- Demands for equal outcomes regardless of process differences
- Dismissal of tradition or established practices as "outdated"
- Advocacy for rapid, transformational change
- Reliance on theoretical models over empirical evidence
- Assumption that good intentions guarantee good results

### 2. ECONOMIC REASONING PATTERNS

**SOWELL-ALIGNED ECONOMIC THINKING:**
- Recognition of scarcity and resource allocation trade-offs
- Understanding of price mechanisms and market coordination
- Skepticism toward price controls, rent controls, minimum wage increases
- Emphasis on supply and demand rather than "fairness" in pricing
- Recognition that economic benefits must come from increased production, not redistribution
- Understanding of opportunity costs in decision-making
- Preference for market-based solutions over government intervention
- Recognition that someone must pay for every "free" benefit
- Understanding of comparative advantage and specialization benefits

**NON-SOWELL ECONOMIC THINKING:**
- Belief that prices can be set by decree without consequences
- Assumption that wealth redistribution creates net benefits
- Ignorance of opportunity costs and trade-offs
- Faith that government spending stimulates economic growth without considering source of funds
- Belief that economic problems can be solved through moral appeals
- Assumption that profits are inherently unfair or exploitative
- Preference for "equity" over efficiency without understanding costs

### 3. KNOWLEDGE AND DECISION-MAKING ANALYSIS

**SOWELL-ALIGNED KNOWLEDGE CONCEPTS:**
- Recognition that knowledge is dispersed throughout society
- Preference for local knowledge over centralized expertise
- Understanding that market prices convey information
- Skepticism toward central planning by experts
- Appreciation for evolved systems (traditions, customs, markets)
- Recognition of the limitations of individual rationality
- Preference for trial-and-error over comprehensive planning
- Understanding that much valuable knowledge is tacit and experiential

**EXPERT-CENTRIC APPROACHES (Sowell-opposed):**
- Faith that educated experts can design better systems than evolved ones
- Belief that rational analysis should override traditional practices
- Assumption that centralized planning is superior to distributed decision-making
- Dismissal of "folk wisdom" or practical experience
- Confidence that complex systems can be understood and controlled by smart people

### 4. SOCIAL AND CULTURAL ANALYSIS

**SOWELL-ALIGNED CULTURAL THINKING:**
- Recognition that cultural factors influence group outcomes
- Understanding that different groups may have different values and practices
- Skepticism toward attributing all group differences to discrimination
- Recognition that cultural capital matters for success
- Understanding that some cultural practices may be more conducive to success than others
- Preference for evidence over ideology in explaining disparities

**STRUCTURAL/SYSTEMIC EXPLANATIONS (Often Sowell-opposed):**
- Attribution of all group differences to discrimination or systemic barriers
- Assumption that equal representation should occur naturally without cultural factors
- Belief that all cultures are equally conducive to economic success
- Dismissal of behavioral or cultural explanations for group differences
- Faith that changing laws or institutions will automatically change outcomes

## DETAILED ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS

### STEP 1: SPEAKER CATEGORIZATION
For each speaker, create a profile noting:
- Primary vision tendency (constrained/unconstrained/mixed)
- Economic reasoning sophistication level
- Evidence vs. ideology ratio in arguments
- Specific quotes that exemplify their thinking pattern

### STEP 2: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE ANALYSIS
Identify instances of:
- **Trade-off thinking** vs. **zero-sum assumptions**
- **Process focus** vs. **outcome focus**
- **Empirical evidence** vs. **theoretical assertions**
- **Systemic explanations** vs. **intentional explanations**
- **Practical considerations** vs. **moral imperatives**

### STEP 3: POLICY REASONING EVALUATION
For any policy discussions, note:
- Whether speakers consider unintended consequences
- If they discuss who bears the costs of proposed benefits
- Whether they reference historical precedents or evidence
- If they consider implementation feasibility
- Whether they acknowledge trade-offs and opportunity costs

### STEP 4: PROBLEM-SOLVING APPROACHES
Categorize proposed solutions as:
- **Incremental/evolutionary** (Sowell-aligned)
- **Comprehensive/revolutionary** (typically Sowell-opposed)
- **Market-based** vs. **government-directed**
- **Incentive-focused** vs. **education/awareness-focused**

### STEP 5: LANGUAGE AND RHETORIC ANALYSIS
Flag language patterns:
- **Sowell-aligned terms:** "trade-offs," "unintended consequences," "incentives," "evidence shows," "historically," "market forces"
- **Unconstrained vision terms:** "social justice," "systemic change," "root causes," "comprehensive solution," "moral imperative," "experts recommend"
