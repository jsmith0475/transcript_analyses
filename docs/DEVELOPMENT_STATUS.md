# Transcript Analysis Tool - Development Status

Last Updated: September 11, 2025  
Current Phase: Async pipeline and Stage B complete; proactive notifications and autonomous verification in place

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ‚úÖ Completed Components

### 1. Infrastructure (100% Complete)
- Docker environment configured (Flask, Redis, Celery)
- docker-compose.yml with service orchestration
- Redis configured for job queue and session storage
- Celery worker configured with proper queue

### 2. Core Backend (100% Complete)
- Flask application with app factory pattern
- API endpoints:
  - /api/health ‚Äî Health check
  - /api/analyze ‚Äî Async job submission
  - /api/status/{job_id} ‚Äî Job status retrieval
- Flask-Socket.IO integration for progress updates
- Redis-based job status tracking

### 3. LLM Integration (100% Complete)
- OpenAI client with real GPT calls via .env
- Token usage tracking and reporting
- Jinja2 prompt template system
- Token budgets:
  - Stage A configured per-analyzer constraint (pattern established)
  - Stage B context token budget enforcement added (config-driven, default 8000 tokens)

### 4. Stage A Analyzers (100% Complete)
- say_means
- perspective_perception
- premises_assertions
- postulate_theorem

All validated on sample transcript with real API calls and persisted JSON/Markdown outputs.

### 5. Stage B Analyzers (100% Complete)
- competing_hypotheses (ACH)
- first_principles
- determining_factors
- patentability

All operate over aggregated Stage A context with enforced context token budget. Results persisted per analyzer in run directory.

### 6. Orchestration and Notifications (100% Complete)
- Async Orchestrator (src/app/async_orchestrator.py):
  - Parallel Stage A, then parallel Stage B using asyncio and bounded concurrency (Semaphore)
  - Writes executive_summary.md, metadata.json, final_status.json, and COMPLETED sentinel
  - Emits lifecycle notifications: pipeline_started, stage_started, stage_completed, pipeline_completed/pipeline_error
- Celery/Web Orchestrator (src/app/orchestration.py):
  - Processes Stage A then Stage B; emits Socket.IO events
  - Writes job artifacts under output/jobs/{jobId}/ including final_status.json and COMPLETED sentinel (success only)
  - Emits proactive notifications using NotificationManager
- NotificationManager (src/app/notify.py):
  - Channels: Slack webhook, generic Webhook, Desktop (macOS say/terminal-notifier/log), FileChannel (JSONL)
  - Best-effort, throttled; includes file:// link to run/job directory when available

### 7. Run Artifacts and Output Organization (100% Complete)
- Async runs (output/runs/run_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/):
  - intermediate/stage_a/* and intermediate/stage_b/*
  - final/executive_summary.md
  - metadata.json
  - COMPLETED (sentinel on success)
  - final_status.json (machine-readable summary including stage analyzers, tokens, cpu_time_seconds, wall_clock_seconds, timestamps)
- Celery jobs (output/jobs/{jobId}/):
  - COMPLETED (sentinel on success)
  - final_status.json (machine-readable job summary)

### 8. Autonomous Notification Verification (100% Complete)
- scripts/verify_notifications.py:
  - Runs async pipeline with FileChannel enabled
  - Parses JSONL notifications for pipeline_completed
  - Validates run artifacts: COMPLETED and final_status.json, plus executive_summary.md

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üß™ Testing & Validation

- Async autonomous verification (real GPT calls):
  - python3 scripts/verify_notifications.py
  - SUCCESS observed; pipeline_completed event recorded in output/notifications_*.jsonl
  - Validated run directory: COMPLETED + final_status.json + final/executive_summary.md
- Async pipeline summary example (60k-char transcript):
  - 8/8 analyzers succeeded
  - Total tokens ~ 89k‚Äì91k
  - Wall-clock ~ 414‚Äì418 seconds (parallelized)
- Stage token/timing samples (vary with model and load):
  - Stage A: individual analyzers ~76‚Äì165s cumulatively
  - Stage B: individual analyzers ~43‚Äì147s cumulatively
- Celery path validation:
  - Job status persisted to Redis and artifacts written to output/jobs/{jobId}/
  - Notifications emitted on start, per-stage events, and completion

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üìä Current Metrics (Recent Async Runs)
- Successful analyzers: 8/8
- Total tokens: ~89,700‚Äì90,800
- Wall-clock (pipeline): ~414‚Äì418s (for ~60k characters input)
- FileChannel notification payload includes file:// link to results

Note: cpu_time_seconds (sum of analyzer processing_time) and wall_clock_seconds are both recorded in final_status.json.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üîß Recent Fixes and Enhancements
1. Stage B context token budget enforcement (base_analyzer formatting)
2. Async parallel orchestrator implemented with bounded concurrency (Stage A and B)
3. Proactive notifications unified via NotificationManager (Slack/Webhook/Desktop/File)
4. FileChannel JSONL + autonomous verification (scripts/verify_notifications.py)
5. Standardized completion markers:
   - COMPLETED sentinel on success
   - final_status.json machine-readable summary written for async runs and Celery jobs
6. Orchestrator time reporting clarified (cpu_time_seconds vs wall_clock_seconds)
7. Async orchestrator return updated to report cpu_time_seconds consistently
8. Filesystem‚Äëdriven analyzer lists: stage lists now come from scanning `prompts/` at startup and on Rescan. Filenames determine slugs; no numeric prefixes required.
9. Rescan refreshes worker: the Celery worker reloads registry/config during Rescan, so prompt changes are picked up without restarts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üöÄ Next Steps (Priority)
1. Final Stage outputs (Meeting Notes, Composite Note) into final/ and integrated into pipeline
2. Web UI progress enhancements and exports (Socket.IO-driven per-analyzer cards; md/json/clipboard)
3. Performance tuning toward PRD target (‚â§60s median for 10k words at scale):
   - Tune MAX_CONCURRENT
   - Tune STAGE_B_CONTEXT_TOKEN_BUDGET
   - Consider structured context reducer for Stage B
4. Caching Layer (24h) for analyzer results
5. Optional: Batch processing and API endpoints for multi-run workflows

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üîÑ How to Resume Development

### 1) Autonomous verification (recommended)
```bash
python3 scripts/verify_notifications.py
```

### 2) Manual async pipeline with FileChannel notifications
```bash
python3 scripts/test_parallel_pipeline.py --notify file --file-path output/notifications.jsonl
```

### 3) Web stack
```bash
docker compose up -d
curl -s http://localhost:5001/api/health | python3 -m json.tool
# Submit an analysis and poll status using /api/analyze and /api/status/{jobId}
```

Artifacts to confirm on completion:
- Async: output/runs/run_*/COMPLETED and final_status.json
- Web: output/jobs/{jobId}/COMPLETED and final_status.json

Notes:
- All pipelines use real GPT calls via your .env
- Use FileChannel for autonomous, offline-capable verification of completion
