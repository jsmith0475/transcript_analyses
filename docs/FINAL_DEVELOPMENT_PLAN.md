# Transcript Analysis Tool - Final Development & Test Plan

## Executive Summary
This document outlines the comprehensive plan to develop, code, and test the Transcript Analysis Tool as specified in the PRD. The system processes transcripts through a three-stage analysis pipeline using GPT-4, with a web interface for real-time monitoring and prompt customization.

## Current Status ‚úÖ
- **Infrastructure**: Docker containers running (Flask, Redis, Celery)
- **Core Pipeline**: Functional with real GPT API calls
- **Web Interface**: Operational with progress tracking
- **Issue Resolved**: Redis persistence error fixed, jobs now processing correctly

## System Architecture

### Components
1. **Web Application** (Flask + Socket.IO)
   - REST API endpoints
   - WebSocket for real-time updates
   - Static file serving

2. **Task Queue** (Celery + Redis)
   - Asynchronous job processing
   - Status persistence
   - Progress tracking

3. **Analysis Pipeline**
   - Stage A: 4 transcript analyzers
   - Stage B: 4 results analyzers  
   - Final Stage: 2 output generators

4. **LLM Integration**
   - OpenAI GPT-4 API client
   - Token usage tracking
   - Error handling & retries

- Verify all analyzers complete
- Download/view results
- Custom prompt selection
```

### 4. Performance Testing
```python
# Measure system limits
- Concurrent job processing
- Large transcript handling
- Token usage optimization
- Response time benchmarks
```

## Test Scripts

### Quick Smoke Test
```bash
# Already implemented in scripts/test_api.py
python3 scripts/test_api.py
```

### Full Pipeline Test
```bash
# Test with real transcript
python3 scripts/test_full_pipeline.py
```

### Load Test
```bash
# Submit multiple concurrent jobs
python3 scripts/load_test.py --jobs 10 --transcript sample.txt
```

## Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] OpenAI API key validated
- [ ] Redis persistence configured
- [ ] Celery workers scaled appropriately

### Deployment Steps
1. Build Docker images
2. Run database migrations (if any)
3. Start Redis container
4. Start Celery workers
5. Start Flask application
6. Verify health endpoints
7. Run smoke tests

### Post-Deployment

- [ ] Test with production transcript
- [ ] Monitor system resources

## Key Metrics to Track

### Performance Metrics
- Average processing time per analyzer
- Total pipeline execution time
- Token usage per analysis
- Concurrent job capacity
- Memory usage patterns

### Quality Metrics
- Analysis accuracy (manual review)
- Error rates by analyzer
- Retry success rates
- User satisfaction scores

### System Metrics
- API response times
- WebSocket latency
- Redis memory usage
- Celery queue depth
- Docker container health

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **OpenAI API Rate Limits**
   - Mitigation: Implement exponential backoff
   - Fallback: Queue management

2. **Memory Exhaustion**
   - Mitigation: Stream large transcripts
   - Monitoring: Set memory alerts

3. **Redis Persistence Issues**
   - Mitigation: Regular backups
   - Recovery: Job replay capability

### Operational Risks
1. **High Token Costs**
   - Mitigation: Token usage monitoring
   - Controls: Per-job limits

2. **Concurrent Load**
   - Mitigation: Queue throttling
   - Scaling: Horizontal worker scaling

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Verify Web UI** ‚úÖ
