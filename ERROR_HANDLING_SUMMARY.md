# Error Handling and Orchestration Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Error State Persistence
**Problem**: When analyzers failed (e.g., using non-existent GPT-5 model), the error state wasn't persisted to Redis, causing UI tiles to remain stuck in "In Process" state.

**Solution Applied**:
- Added error persistence in `run_stage_a_analyzer` and `run_stage_b_analyzer` exception handlers
- Errors now save to Redis with status="error" and error_message
- Added `analyzer_error` event emission to notify UI

### 2. Stage Sequencing 
**Initial Problem**: Stages appeared to run in parallel (Stage B and Final starting while Stage A was processing)

**Investigation Result**: 
- The stages ARE actually properly chained using Celery chord/chain primitives
- Stage B waits for Stage A completion, Final waits for Stage B completion
- The issue was that when analyzers fail quickly, it appears they're running in parallel
- Confirmed via logs: Stage B starts only after Stage A completes (with errors)

### 3. Final Stage Premature Execution
**Problem**: `run_final_stage` had fallback logic that loaded from Redis if `all_results` was None

**Solution Applied**:
- Made `all_results` parameter required (not Optional)
- Removed fallback to Redis loading
- Final stage now requires Stage B results to be passed explicitly

## Test Results with GPT-5 (non-existent model)

When using GPT-5, all analyzers fail with:
```
"Unsupported parameter: 'max_tokens' is not supported with this model. Use 'max_completion_tokens' instead."
```

This confirms:
1. Real API calls are being made (not mocked)
2. Errors are being caught and handled
3. Pipeline continues even when analyzers fail (by design when stop_on_error=false)
4. Stages execute in proper sequence: A → B → Final

## Files Modified

1. **src/app/sockets.py**
   - Added `analyzer_error` event emitter

2. **src/app/parallel_orchestration.py**
   - Added error persistence in Stage A/B analyzer exception handlers
   - Modified `run_final_stage` to require `all_results` parameter
   - Import and use `analyzer_error` for error notifications

3. **src/app/static/js/ui.js**
   - Updated to handle `analyzer.error` events
   - Error tiles now show red badge
   - Errors count as completed for progress tracking

## Remaining Considerations

1. **UI Tile Updates**: The UI may need additional work to properly reflect error states immediately
2. **Stop on Error**: The `stop_on_error` configuration option should be tested to ensure pipeline halts when desired
3. **Error Message Display**: Consider adding tooltips or modals to show full error messages to users

## Verification Steps

1. ✅ Error states persist to Redis
2. ✅ Stages execute sequentially (not in parallel)
3. ✅ Final stage requires Stage B completion
4. ✅ Real API calls are made (confirmed by GPT-5 errors)
5. ⚠️  UI error tile rendering may need additional testing

## Next Steps

- Test with valid models to ensure normal flow works
- Test `stop_on_error=true` configuration
- Consider implementing retry logic for transient failures
- Add comprehensive error reporting in UI
